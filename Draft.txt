# The STEM view of Ethics

Intro
Title is kinda fake lol, but really I just want to present a certain analogy for Ethics.

Common criticisms of utilitarianism:
    - It's too hard to live up to. That makes me feel bad
    - It's too hard to know what utilitarianism actually prescribes in any given situation.
    - People use utilitarianism as a justification for horrible actions sometimes (e.g. FTX, etc.)
