Here's some AI generated photos of me. Some of them are pretty wacky/uncanny and many do not really look like me, but I thought they might be pretty funny to look at. Also maybe interesting as a historical document after personalised AI generated images get vastly vastly better (unless they already have). For some reason it often generated me as having an earring, and also often generated me with a lazy eye; neither of which I (as of writing) have.
