Currently I am living in London, working at the [LISA](https://www.safeai.org.uk) offices. I'm working for the [ARENA Programme](https://arena.education), teaching people deep learning skills for AI safety.

This playlist is what I'm currently listening to 'on repeat' according to Spotify. I'm not exactly sure how Spotify calculates this playlist, but in my experience it has not been *entirely* accurate week-to-week. Despite that, it definitely gets at something, and there is a decent chance I'll be listening to one of these songs at the time you're reading this. 

Books I'm currently reading:

- Fiction: *A Place of Greater Safety* - Hilary Mantel

- Nonfiction: *An Introduction to Contemporary Metaethics* - Alexander Miller

- Nonfiction Audiobook: *The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict: A Very Short Introduction*

If you see me in person and have any questions about any of these books, I'd be happy to talk more about them.
