Currently I am living in London, working at the [LISA](https://www.safeai.org.uk) offices. I'm working for the [ARENA Programme](https://arena.education), teaching people deep learning skills for AI safety.

The playlist to the left is what I'm currently listening to 'On Repeat' according to Spotify. In my experience it has not been *entirely* accurate. Despite that, it definitely gets at something, and there is probably a 5% chance that I'll be listening to one of these songs at any given time you might be reading this.
