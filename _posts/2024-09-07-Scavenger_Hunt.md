The following is a scavenger hunt I designed for ARENAv4. If you want to do it, it should remain functional on my Google Drive. Maybe things will eventually be deprecated/removed from museums, and it won't continue to work, but I think it should stand the test of time decently (once I fix the Bust of Pericles, which is no longer at the British Museum).

# Scavenger Hunt Rules

Here are the rules and tips for the scavenger hunt:

- There are **10 points** for each photo in the "mainline" scavenger hunt. Don't worry about getting every photo. Make sure the photos **include at least one of your team mates (or yourself)**!

- The form of the scavenger hunt will be a series of google forms, the first of which is linked below, and subsequent ones will be emailed to you as you submit earlier ones.

- When you submit your photos, **make sure your email is included** to receive the next clue.

- You're totally allowed to **google things**/ask strangers or museum staff or attendees for help!

- You'll need to have someone who **has data**.

- There are 5 points for each of the bonus categories as you work your way through London, listed below.

- **Have fun with it**. If you all really like a museum and don't mind as much about seeing the future ones, then spend some more time there. This is meant to show you London!

# Bonus Scavenger Hunt Items

All of these are **limited to one per team**! Don't worry about submitting them, we can just figure it out at the end.

- A chicken shop blatantly ripping off "KFC"

- Any non-standard pedestrian crossing light

- Overpriced avocado toast (At least £15)

- A British Souvenir with a tag showing "Made in China"

- A deeply silly pub name (Remember we're in the UK, the [bar for silly names is high](https://www.google.com/search?q=silly+uk+place+names&rlz=1C1CHBF_enGB1067GB1067&oq=silly+uk+place+n&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBggBEEUYOTIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjIICAUQABgWGB4yCAgGEAAYFhgeMg0IBxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0ICBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoICRAAGKIEGIkF0gEIMTY0NGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8); I won't accept "The Slug and Lettuce!")

- Someone blocking people's paths by standing on the wrong side of a tube escalator

Your first location:

The journey starts, your quest begins,<br>
From where you work, to ancient things.<br>
Step outside and take your way,<br>
To where the **Tower** guards the day.<br>
<br>
Through bustling streets and London’s hum,<br>
The Thames will guide you as you come.<br>
To walls that whisper tales of old,<br>
Of crowns, and jewels, and secrets bold.<br>
<br>
So leave the desk, the time is now,<br>
The Tower awaits—go make your vow.<br>
Let history’s gates your path unfold,<br>
Adventure calls, as tales are told.<br>
