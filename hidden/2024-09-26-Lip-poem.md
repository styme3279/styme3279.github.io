### Lip 

The tongue tentative at first<br>
Browsing bumps and cracks;<br>
Any imperfection.<br>
There's one just here, it reports,<br>
Solitary on the plains of the lip.<br>

Crag taken to the teeth in a dance.<br>
Ushered gently by the tongue,<br>
Snuggled in place, tucked into enamel<br>
Tightly.<br>
Gripped now by teeth.<br>

Supported once by the suction,<br>
Alone now. Dangling.<br>
Until its own weight's too much<br>
And the long fall begins. Tearing off<br>
Like a badly peeled orange.<br>

A flush of red flows to fill the<br>
fissure no longer veiled in skin.<br>
They've bored too deep this time<br>
But let geology take its course.<br>
They'll be digging again in no time.<br>
