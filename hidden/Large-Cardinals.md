## Language of set theory

## Introduction to the axioms 

### Axiom of Empty set

This axiom states: $$\exists a \nexists b : b \in a$$

### Axiom of Extenion

This axiom states: $$ (\forall c, c \in a \iff c \in b) \rightarrow a = b$$

### Axiom of Foundation

This axiom states:

$$ $$

Thinking:

We want foundation. This is the claim that there's no infinite descending sequence of inclusions in set theory.

no infinite descending series is equivalent to existence of a final element in the chain.

so if 

\exists b and \exists a_{1}, a_{2}, ... a_{\omega}

such that

a_{1} \in b
a_{2} \in a_{1}
a_{3} \in a_{2}
...

axiom doesn't state that there exists a set disallowing this infinite chain (no such object can exist)

axiom states that there is in fact no such infinite chain in the first place.

kind of clunky but one way to phrase it is simply as there does not exist such an infinite chain, maybe that's what they do (requires axiom of infinity and parameterization).


I think the way the axiom does this is by "cutting the chain off at the feet" as it were. By
