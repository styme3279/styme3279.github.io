# Scavenger Hunt Rules

Here are the rules and tips for the scavenger hunt:

- There are 10 points for each photo in the "mainline" scavenger hunt. Don't worry about getting every photo.

- You're totally allowed to google things/ask strangers or museum staff or attendees for help!

- You'll need to have someone who has data. If you can't submit photos, or anything else goes wrong then DM me on slack (which is "James Hindmarch").

- There are 5 points for each of the bonus categories as you work your way through London, listed below.

- Have fun with it. If you all really like a museum and don't mind as much about seeing the future ones, then spend some more time there.

- Buy a Tesco meal-deal before you leave for Lunch. When I did this I got really hungry halfway through and couldn't find much to eat for cheap.

Your first location:

The journey starts, your quest begins,<br>
From where you work, to ancient things.<br>
Step outside and take your way,<br>
To where the **Tower** guards the day.<br>
<br>
Through bustling streets and London’s hum,<br>
The Thames will guide you as you come.<br>
To walls that whisper tales of old,<br>
Of crowns, and jewels, and secrets bold.<br>
<br>
So leave the desk, the time is now,<br>
The Tower awaits—go make your vow.<br>
Let history’s gates your path unfold,<br>
Adventure calls, as tales are told.<br>
